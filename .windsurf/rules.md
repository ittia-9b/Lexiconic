# Project Rules

## Code Changes
- Always execute your proposed changes. You don't have to wait for me to confirm.
- When making code modifications, implement them immediately using the appropriate tools.
- Don't ask for permission before making changes - just do them and explain what you did.

## Development Workflow  
- Be proactive in running commands and testing code after making changes.
- If you identify improvements or fixes, implement them directly.
- Provide brief summaries of changes made rather than asking if I want them made.
